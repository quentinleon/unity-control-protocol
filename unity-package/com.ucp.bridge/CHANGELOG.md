# Changelog

## [0.6.3] - Unreleased

### Added

- Added the `ui/list`, `ui/lint`, `ui/inspect`, `ui/screenshot`, `ui/check`, and `ui/status`
  RPCs plus the `ui/result` completion notification for UI Toolkit authoring on Unity 6 and
  newer. On older editors the methods are registered but return an explicit unsupported error.
- Lint runs the synchronous UXML/USS/TSS importers, reads their import logs and
  `importedWithErrors`/`importedWithWarnings` flags, follows UI dependencies, and clone-probes
  each `VisualTreeAsset` under a scoped log capture. Immutable package assets are inspected from
  their existing import artifacts without a forced reimport.
- Render operations (`inspect`, `screenshot`, `check`) are queued and ticked on
  `EditorApplication.update` in a transient `HideAndDontSave` utility window, wait for stable
  finite geometry and stable pixels, capture through `InternalEditorUtility.CaptureEditorWindow`
  with DPI compensation, write PNGs under `Library/UCP/UiCaptures`, and restore the previously
  focused window. A 300-second overall ceiling and per-state settle timeouts bound every run;
  `BridgeServer.Shutdown` fails in-flight operations with `editor_shutdown` before a reload.
- Scenario support: strict `.ucp-ui.json` parsing with unknown-field rejection, deep data
  overlays, an allowlisted `set` block, `repeat` and virtualized `list-view` collections driven
  by JSON pointers, and automatic rewriting of `DataBinding` paths to dictionary keys through
  `Unity.Properties`.

### Fixed

- `screenshot` with `view: "game"` now composites UI Toolkit screen-space overlays into the
  capture. `Camera.Render()` draws the scene but not the runtime UI Toolkit panels, so every
  `UIDocument`/`PanelRenderer` overlay was missing from the PNG. The screen-space panels on the
  captured display are redirected to the screenshot render target, laid out, repainted, and
  rendered into it, then restored and repainted for the game view again. Panels the caller
  already routes to their own render texture, transient panels, and world-space panels are left
  alone. The `UnityEngine.UIElements` internals this needs are resolved by reflection and their
  Unity 6000.2 renames are handled; an editmode test fails if a future version drops one instead
  of silently returning a camera-only image.
- Removed the empty `UCP.Bridge.Runtime` assembly definition that logged an "will not be
  compiled, because it has no scripts associated with it" warning on every import (#4).

## [0.6.2] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Added native, scene-object-free `record/start`, `record/stop`, `record/status`, `record/arm`, and
  `record/signal` RPCs for Game and Scene view video capture.
- Added aspect-preserving longest-edge sizing and explicit width/height canvases with letterboxing,
  even-dimension normalization, configurable FPS/bitrate/duration, H.264/MP4 and VP8/WebM encoding,
  and platform-aware format selection.
- Added play-enter, play-exit, bounded log-regex, and named-signal triggers. Armed play triggers use
  `SessionState` to survive domain reloads, and `record/stop` also cancels a pending trigger.
- Added a `slowdown` parameter to `record/start` and `record/arm`. Frames are still captured at the
  requested cadence in real time; only the encoder's declared frame rate is divided by the factor, so
  playback is stretched without duplicating frames or re-encoding. `record/status` reports both
  `slowdown` and the resulting `playbackFps`. Values outside 1-20 are rejected. This raises effective
  temporal resolution for consumers that sample a clip at a fixed low rate rather than playing it.
- Documented that `record/start --view game` resolves `Camera.main`, not the Game view's composited
  camera stack. Projects rendering through several enabled cameras record only the `MainCamera`-tagged
  one, and camera depth does not change the selection; `--view scene` captures the Scene view camera,
  which is unaffected by gameplay.

### Fixed

- Fixed `tests/run` counting an empty root suite as a passed test. When a filter matched nothing,
  the run finished with a childless root whose result was collected as a leaf, so the summary
  reported one passed test named after the project. Suite results are now skipped, so a run that
  executed nothing reports a total of zero.
- Changed `tests/run` filtering from `Filter.testNames` to `Filter.groupNames`. `testNames` requires
  an exact fully-qualified match, which silently selected nothing for a class or method name;
  `groupNames` is matched as a regular expression against each test's full name, so partial names
  select what a caller expects and fully-qualified names still match.
- Fixed `object/get-property` double-converting values that `SerializedPropertyToValue` had already
  shaped for JSON. `GetPropertyValue` resolves a name through `SerializedObject.FindProperty` first
  and returns a ready `List`/`Dictionary`; `ConvertToJson` then ran over that result, matched none
  of its cases, and fell through to `value.ToString()`. A `Vector3` field came back as
  ``"System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.Object]"`` with
  ``"type": "List`1"``. Every serialized Vector2/3/4, Quaternion, Color, Rect, Bounds and
  object-reference field was affected, and float fields reported a `Double` type name.
  `get-property` now takes its type name from the `SerializedProperty` so it agrees with
  `get-fields`, converts only values read through the reflection fallback, and `ConvertToJson` is
  idempotent for already-shaped `IList`/`IDictionary` values.

### Performance

- Frames render through a hidden reusable `RenderTexture` and reusable CPU readback texture into
  Unity's native `MediaEncoder`; recording creates no scene objects or scripts and avoids per-frame
  managed texture allocation.

### Reliability

- Added sibling `.partial` output and final rename, explicit overwrite handling, extension/format
  validation, encoder and temporary-file cleanup on failure, detached safety deadlines, trigger wait
  deadlines, dropped-frame accounting, and structured completed/failed status metadata.
- Active encoders finalize during assembly reload or editor shutdown. Play-boundary capture is
  handled by the persisted `play-enter`/`play-exit` arm flow rather than attempting to retain a
  native encoder across a domain reload.

### Tests

- Added editor smoke tests for recording RPC registration and idle status, aspect-preserving even
  dimensions, signal matching, and cancellation of armed recordings.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- Added `asset/reimport` for explicit targeted Unity reimport of an asset or its `.meta` file.
- Added `asset/import-settings/read`, `asset/import-settings/write`, and `asset/import-settings/write-batch` for importer-aware settings inspection and updates.

### Changed

- File writes and patches now trigger targeted synchronous reimport for edited assets and `.meta` files under `Assets/` and `Packages/`.
- Importer settings writes now save through Unity's importer pipeline and reimport automatically by default, with an opt-out path for deferred apply workflows.
- Asset metadata responses now include the importer type when Unity resolves one for the target path.

### Fixed

- Fixed imported asset workflows that previously required manual `.meta` editing and separate reimport steps before changes became visible in the editor.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Added `scene/focus` so the CLI can align the Unity Scene view to a target object for screenshot-driven iteration.
- Added smoke coverage for asset refresh after `file/write` and Scene view focus axis handling.

### Changed

- `scene/focus` now exposes the stable axis-alignment workflow only, without public distance overrides.

### Fixed

- Fixed `file/write` and `file/patch` so changes under `Assets/` and `Packages/` trigger a synchronous `AssetDatabase.Refresh`, making newly created scripts and assets available immediately.
- Fixed Scene view focus behavior and validation coverage so live automation and package smoke tests agree on the resulting alignment.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added missing Unity metadata for `EditorController.cs` and `ObjectReferenceResolver.cs` so both controllers import reliably in embedded and tracked package installs.

### Changed

- `CommandRouter` now maps `ArgumentException` to `InvalidParams` and `UnauthorizedAccessException` to `FileAccessDenied` without emitting misleading internal-error logs.

### Fixed

- Fixed negative smoke tests around unresolved object references and project-root path traversal.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added `editor/quit` so the CLI can request graceful Unity editor shutdown before falling back to OS-level close/terminate behavior.

### Changed

- Bridge server registration now includes editor lifecycle RPC handlers alongside the existing play, compile, scene, asset, and build controllers.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added `asset/write-batch` for multi-field serialized asset updates in one bridge call.

### Changed

- Player settings now expose `defaultIsNativeResolution` so installer automation can reconcile live editor state as well as on-disk project settings.
- Object reference payloads now include asset `path` and `guid` when available.

### Fixed

- Fixed buffered log searches by applying regex filtering before count truncation.
- Fixed buffered log list requests being capped to 10 returned entries regardless of requested `count`.
- Fixed serialized object reference writes silently accepting unresolved references in both object and asset controllers.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- Dirty-scene automation controls in bridge scene/play handlers so unattended CLI workflows can avoid save-confirmation modal interruptions.

### Changed

- Scene load and play entry now auto-handle dirty scenes by default for non-interactive automation flows.

### Fixed

- Fixed edit-mode test execution when called during Play Mode by deferring run start until Play Mode exits.
- Fixed workflow interruptions caused by Unity save-scene prompts during scene transitions and play mode entry.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- Fixed the release packaging pipeline so metadata validation no longer depends on optional website-only files

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-12

### Changed

- The bridge is now intended to be consumed through CLI-managed local mounts by default, with tracked manifest installation remaining an explicit opt-in path

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- `LogsController` buffered history support for `logs/tail`, `logs/search`, and `logs/get`
- EditMode smoke coverage for buffered log truncation, regex filtering, and id-window filtering

### Changed

- Snapshot responses remain shallow by default and log-heavy reads are now designed for summary-first inspection

### Fixed

- EditMode test duration reporting now uses the editor uptime clock to avoid negative durations

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- Asset controller for asset search, inspection, field reads, writes, and ScriptableObject creation
- Property and hierarchy controllers for GameObject, component, and hierarchy manipulation
- Material controller for shader properties and keywords
- Prefab controller for status, overrides, apply, revert, unpack, and prefab creation
- Editor settings controller for player, quality, physics, lighting, tags, and layers
- Build controller for targets, scenes, scripting defines, and build execution

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- Initial WebSocket bridge server
- Play/stop/pause control
- Compilation trigger
- Scene management (list, load, active)
- State snapshots
- Screenshot capture (Game view)
- Console log streaming
- Test runner integration
- File read/write/patch operations
- JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
- Lock file discovery mechanism
